This is a Set of different Scripts for my mostly
working Applications SupperCollider and OpenMusic
and LMMS. The Programms here are very different.
It beginns with Players of Tone Sequences written
in SuperCollider. Here we have a Fifth Player, this
Script Plays Notes in Connection of the Fifth Interval.
Or a OverTone Synth which Plays a Set of Notes in 
which the later Sounds are OverTones or Diverence Sounds
to the first Sounds. A other Idea was the Aspect of
Chord Breaking to make a Song.
All this Scripts was created in the August of 2024.
And are verry diferent. The Inspirarion for this
Scripts are all from the Cromatic MindMap.
I hope Somebody will like this little Scripts and
plays a little bit with this Scripts and listen to
the Music I have made with them.
